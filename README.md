# PayPal Case Study
## Overview and Origin
### PayPal, an online payment platform, was founded in December 1998 in Palo Alto, California by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek. 
### Paypal was created when X.com and Confinity merged. With little success in the security software business, Confinity changed its mission. The new goal of Confinity, re-named PayPal, was to "create the world's first digital payment platform, making money work better, faster, and easier than ever."
