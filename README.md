# PayPal Case Study

The founders were attempting to rectify the issue of slow turnaround for online transactions. 
### *Funding* 
### PayPal is funded by charging merchants fees on transactions and services. Further, around 20 years ago, they raised around $300M over five rounds of funding by issuing debt.
