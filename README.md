# PayPal Case Study
## Overview and Origin
### *History*
### PayPal, an online payment platform, was founded in December 1998 in Palo Alto, California by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek. 
### Paypal was created when X.com and Confinity merged. With little success in the security software business,the founder's of Confinity decided to change the company's mission. The new goal of Confinity, re-named PayPal, was to "create the world's first digital payment platform, making money work better, faster, and easier than ever". The founders were attempting to rectify the issue of slow turnaround for online transactions. 
### *Funding* 
### PayPal is funded by charging merchants fees on transactions and services. Further, around 20 years ago, they raised around $300M over five rounds of funding by issuing debt. However, in 2002 eBay bought PayPal for $1.5B. Now, PayPal is a public company that is funded through cash flow from operations that used to be part of eBay.
## Business Activities 
### *Problem Analysis* 
### Paypal is attempting to solve problems regarding payment processing for merchants. Payment processing issues can affect revenue, customer satisfaction, system difficulties, fraud, and overall company alignment. All of PayPal's goals and missions stemmed from their original identified painpoint of slow turnaround in online transactions.
### For example, some of the main issues that PayPal helps to solve is abandoned carts, increased payment choices, optimizing payment processing, single integration, fraud prevention, global expansion, and agile systems. Paypal offers services to comabt these issues such as offering customers more choices when paying for products, optimizing payment processing to boost authorization rates, a single integration for all payment needs, fraud protection tools, a global presence, and a fully customizable platform.
### *Intended Customer*

### PayPal's intended customer is merchants and individuals who obtain online payments. Espeically those with global operations, as PayPal allows users to pay in different currencies. Further, certain users use PayPal to transfer their friends, family, peers, etc. 
### When analyzing the marketsize of this group, it is very large. There are over 26 million ecommerce sites and stores across the world. Further, more than 2 billion people use mobile payments across the world, making this an extremely large market that PayPal can capitalize on. 
### *Advantage Over Competitors*
### PayPal has a two-sided platform, allowing it to gain insights from all sides of a transaction. This allows them to have a strong understanding of their consumers and their consumer's consumers. Further, given the company's orgin as a security platform, they have an advantage over combating fraud, meaning that individuals are drawn to using the platform in terms of safety and security. These solutions and insights are unmatched by PayPal's competitors.
### *Technology PayPal Uses*

### PayPal employs a digital layer in order to make transfers between bank accounts seamless. The company uses JavaScript and CSS. Further, the content delivery network that PayPal uses is Fastly. 
### In terms of their security, PayPal encrypts transactions by using a 128-bit SSL technology. To ensure that they are accessible from only secure connections, the company uses HTTP technology and UTF-8 technology for character encoding.
## Landscape
### *Domain*
### PayPal is a financial technology companies in the online payment systems domain.
### *Domain Trends*
### In the last 10 years, online payments have increased and become extremely popular. Due to this, there have been many changing trends in the online payment sector. 
### First, over the last 5-10 years mobile payments have become extremely popular as individuals have become more likely to use their phones to pay. This is seen through the increase in apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. Further, this is also seen through contactless payment, as individuals use their phone or cards to tap payment terminals versus paying with cash or inserting their card. 
### Second, there has been a large increase in peer-to-peer payments. This occurs when individuals transfer money to each other versus to a merchant. There are now many applications that help users achieve this. For example, Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, PayPal itself, Interac, etc.
### Third, there has been increased regulations in different countries regarding online payments and the saftey and security behind them. This means that online payment platforms need to pivot to ensure they are following all the new regulations that are constantly being introduced. 
### Fourth, Cryptocurrencies have become a new online digitial currency that has taken place as a new way to make payments. Blockchain technology developments have also emerged, removing intermediaries in the payment sphere.
### Fifth, payment fraud has also been a major trend in this sector. As payments have moved online, they are suceptible to much more risks and uncertainties if they are not properly protected.
### Finally, there has been a massive expansion of global money transfers and cross-border transactions. This has been seen with the simultanious growth of e-commerce platforms and shops. E-commerce platforms have integrated online payment services in order to make business more efficient and cater to a global market.
### To conclude, the last 5-10 years has seen massive expansion of online payments and many different trends and innovations that has allowed this sector to overtake regular cash payments. 
### *Other Major Companies*
### There are many major companies in this domain. The following are a few examples:
### - Stripe
### - Square
### - Alipay
### - Amazon Pay
### - Google Pay
### - Braintree

### - Quickbooks Go Payment
## Results 
### *Business Impact*
### PayPal's 2022 Global Impact report outlines multiple ways that the company is aiming to achieve their mission "to democratize financial services for a more equitable, inclusive, and resilient global economy".
### The company is committed to hiring a diverse workforce of both ethnic and gender diversity. Further, the company has acheived success in their social innovation, helping small-to medium- sized business access $4.2B in capital in 2022 alone. PayPal has also supported their customers by donating 1.4M in 2022 to nonprofits and charities. The company has an Economic Opportunity Fund that invests in minority group-led funds and businesses. The company has also invested heavily into their environmental sustainability, achieving 90% total renewable energy use.
### In addition to their global impact and ESG commitments, PayPal has allowed their customers to have flexible options when completeing payments in adition to allowing their clients access to resources, an international market, and higher conversion rates. All of these things have increased customer satisfaction and established PayPal as the leading provider of digital payment technology. 
### *Core Metrics and Performance*
### Certain metrics that are used to track how successfull payment providers are the following: 
### - Conversion rate (the number of successful transactions)
### - Number of transactions a month or year 
### - Number of active users 
### - Number of new users 
### - Number of errors experienced
### - Total payment volume
### - Transactions per active account
### *PayPal Performance*
### When compared to competitors, PayPal is the market leader holding around 45% of the marketshare and 429 million active users (2022). This makes PayPal a leader in its domain, although certain competitors like Stripe are starting to quickly gain marketshare. Further, PayPal is the most used payment processor on company websites being used on double the number of websites versus its second best alternative. The industry overall is growing at an over 10% CAGR, and PayPal is able to grow along side the industry to continue being a market leader.
## Recommendations
### *Potential New Product Offerings*
### I believe that there are three services that PayPal could introduce in order to enhance the platform for users.
### PayPal could potentially add a service for merchants to gain data insights about their customers, what their customers are buying, and trends that have been seen in their customers. This will allow merchants to be able to better understand their customers and tailor their services and product offerings to their customers more effectively. 
### PayPal can also introduce a budgeting or payment split type feature that allows users to track their payments and allows friends or families to upload how much individuals owe each other. 
### Finally, like many credit card companies, PayPal could offer incentive programs in order to gain new customers and increase the amount of active users. This will increase the total payment volume metric that PayPal analyzes. This could take the form of rewards like cashback or discounts when you complete a certain amount of transactions.
### *Benefits to PayPal*
### I believe that adding these services would enhance PayPal for users. It would increase the flexiblity that users and merchants have in the application and make PayPal an "all-in-one" software. Having a wide reach will increase the users and make it so that PayPal continues to be a market leader. This would increase their revenues, as it would increase the amount of transactions that are completed through the application. Further, it could increase the marketshare of PayPal.
### *Needed Technology*
### The technology that would be needed to achieve this would be higher data analytics software allowing PayPal to track what customers do and a secure platform to share that with merchants. Further, the rewards program would need to be tracked with a specific software in order to create an automated release of the incentives and rewards. In addition to more intensive data analytics software, PayPal would need to incorporate a tracking type of technology that would let individuals put their payments in and share their payments with peers. Certain applications have this function like Splitwise. In order to achieve this, Splitwise uses technology like HTML5, jQuery, and Google Analytics to make their application run.
### *Fit Between Technology, PayPal, and Solution*
### I believe that the technology needed for this additions would be appropriate for PayPal because PayPal already completes very similar services. It is not a new business or venture that would require completely new software. PayPal has experience in many of the technology softwares that would be needed for these new services, therefore, it would be easy to add them to the platform. Further, many of the needed technology PayPal may already use. These technologies would be appropriate for the new services because these services are primarily tracking and sharing data. Therefore, these technologies would be able to complete the tracking and data gathering simply and efficiently.
